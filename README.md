Color Sequencing
=============

__Author:__ Joni Halabi (www.thatdevgirl.com)

Description
-----------

This color sequencing widget was developed as a proof of concept to reorder large numbers of content blocks inside a YUI dialog box, specifically testing using the YUI 3 DragDrop library inside a YUI 2.7 application.  Because, you know, that's totally a thing.

What is in the Javascript?
-------------------------------------

This project contains all of the applicable YUI 2.7 and YUI 3.0 libraries in the /scripts/yui directory.  All of the customization required for the color sequencing dialog is in the color-sequencing.js file.

What is in the CSS?
-------------------

This project contains 3 CSS files:

1. __reset.css:__ Just a basic CSS reset, inspired by the Eric Meyers' CSS reset. 

2. __yui.css:__ The default YUI 2.7 base CSS file.

3. __color-sequencing.css:__ Contains the base CSS for the dialog box and content blocks to be sequenced.
